The exceptions system is simple, just create the extended class and raise when needed.

In the TemplateHome on the _new Template("/pages/{$file}");_ catch the exception in
the case that the file doesn't exist.

During registration if the user is connected, raise an exception.

In case that the session dies, raise an exception.

If the magic token is different, raise an exception.

/send/user/login > If the user is connected
