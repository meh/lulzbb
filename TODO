0.2.2:

    y> User groups.
    y> Caching system.
    y> Output class.
    y> Fix the show of the forum by GET. <- FINISH THIS, OutputHome
       You pass the page to that and it takes care of the content
       Change the Home:Show to insert in <%CONTENT%> the real content
       so it takes the real content and not the page, it's OutputHome's job
       to get the right content etc, because of multiple shit.
    
    y> The navigator has to be fixed with no mercy, remove all the $_POST/$_GET['title']
       and leave there only the level, then just think about some recursive methods to use
       for massive lulz and queries, also remember the caching system, this will save your
       ass from death by queries, so remember, OutputNavigator->WIN();

       Already changed some default shit so the things are going easier, the only thing
       being passed is the frigging id, so i have to separate the thingy from it and get
       ALL the data of that id (title etc) and with the navigator in a separated way get
       all the parents etc in a way to get the real path etc, _REMEMBER_ to cache it because
       it would become fucking huge with the recursive method, k? k

    y> Fix the overall system as said above, the only thing passed is the fucking id and 
       in the case of the topic the possibile post that a fag wants to read, nothing less
       nothing more.

       i hate you javascript ;_;
