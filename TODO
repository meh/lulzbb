Improve the menu.


------------
HAR, menus.

In short, /content/pages /content/menu

menu.group.php

--
<?php die();/*
<menu>
    <group_of_menus>
        <menu href="url" onclick="whatever">TEXT</menu>
    </group_of_menus>
</menu>
*/?>

Parse the file, $root->firstChild->childNodes->geteverything then put everything into an array
and remember to getAttributes and parse everything and put it into an array or some shit, 
or just create the direct link, it would be fukken easy.

Then the template just has to get that array with the groups etc, parse something like
<%MENU-GROUP-(\w+)%> and then check if it has an array with menus, if it has the array it 
replaces the things by looping etc, like usual, if it doesn't it just replaces it with ''.
